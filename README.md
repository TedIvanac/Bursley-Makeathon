# Bursley-Makeathon
Code written for Moon Colony Diorama to be presented at the Bursley Makeathon at the University of Michigan.

Code operates all lights on in the colony diorama. Also gives real-time data on water level inside the model water tank, and the 
light intensity and temperature inside the model farm.
